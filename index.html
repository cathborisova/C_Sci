<h1> This is Catherine Borisova's home page.</h1> <br> Im an 8th grader at MME. 
                               I have two brothers, Daniel and Grigory and a dog, Lassie.
                               I was born in Texas, but later moved to California and then to Minnesota, where I lived in Edina for awhile.
                               Im interested in science, more specifically computer science, space and geology.
                               So obviously, science is my favorite subject in school, but I also like global studies. </p>
