                                <p>I am a cross country runner, a nordic skier and <br>
                                  a photographer. I started running because my dad <br>
                                ran marathons and my mom did track and feild so <br>
                                they pushed me to start running.
                                At first I would run a mile or two every now and <br>
                                then but once I got onto the team I really started<br>
                                enjoying it and have been running a lot more. I got <br>
                                into skiing the same way, my dad was a nordic skier <br>
                                and also advised me to join. At first I didn't like <br>
                                it because I thought it was really hard, but once I <br>
                                got into the hang of it I fell in love with the sport.
                                I joined both sports in 8th grade, but before that I <br>
                                was a rhythmic gymnast, but ended up quitting because <br>
                                I couldn't keep up with school and the sport.
                                I started photography in the beginning of 2016, after <br>
                                  I started taking pictures on my family's vacation in Florida. </p>
