      <title> My hobbies </title>
                                <p>I am a cross country runner, a nordic skier and a photographer.
                                I started running because my dad ran marathons and my mom did track and feild so they pushed me to start running.
                                At first I would run a mile or two every now and then but once I got onto the team I really started enjoying it and have been running a lot more.
                                I got into skiing the same way, my dad was a nordic skier and alos advised me to join. 
                                At first I didn't like it because I thought it was really hard, but once I got into the hang of it I fell in lvoe with the sport.
                                I joined both sports in 8th grade, but before that I was a rhythmic gymnast, but ended up quitting because I couldn't keep up with school and the sport.
                                I started photography in the beginning of 2016, after I started taking pictures on my family's vacation in Florida. </p>
