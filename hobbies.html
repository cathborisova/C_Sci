                                <p>I am a cross country runner, a nordic skier and <br>
                                  a photographer. I started running because my dad <br>
                                ran marathons and my mom did track and feild so <br>
                                they pushed me to start running. At first I would <br>
                                run a mile or two every now and then but once I got<br>
                                onto the team I really started enjoying it and have <br>
                                been running a lot more. I got into skiing the same <br> 
                                way, my dad was a nordic skier and also advised me <br>
                                to join. At first I didn't like it because I thought <br> 
                                it was really hard, but once I got into the hang of it <br>
                                I fell in love with the sport.I joined both sports in <br>
                                8th grade, but before that I was a rhythmic gymnast, <br>
                                but ended up quitting because I couldn't keep up with <br>
                                school and the sport. I started photography in the <br>
                                beginning of 2016, after I started taking pictures <br>
                                on my family's vacation in Florida. </p>
