      <h1> Photography </h1>
<p>I take pictures with my Fuji Film Xe-2 Camera and my lens.
I am waiting to get new, macro lenses so that I can take more close-ups and just photos of smaller things in general. 
I run a photography acc: www.instagram.com/cath.b_photography and I post daily. 
Most of my images are taken while on vacation, and most of them aren't edited. 
I got into photography about a year ago. </p>
<h3> Here are some of my pictures: </h3>
